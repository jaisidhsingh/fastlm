# `fastlm`

A highly-controllable yet easily hackable setup for causal language modeling. Built off of a fork of `plainLM` by the amazing Niccolo Ajroldi.

## Features

- [x] A custom, torch-compilable transformer implementation supporting RoPE, GLU, RMSNorm, GatedDeltaNet, GatedAttention, helpers to easily instantiate hybrid models.
- [x] Distributed training via Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).
- [x] A dedicated script for downloading, tokenizing, and chunking data, making data preparation seamless.

## 🛠 Installation
It is recommended to run `fastlm` in a dedicated Python environment. To install dependencies in a `conda` environment, run:
```bash
conda create --name fastlm python=3.12 -y && conda activate fastlm && cd fastlm
pip install .
```

## 📚 Data
We provide a script for downloading, tokenizing, chunking and saving Hugging Face datasets: `data/datasets/prepare.py`.
You can specify any HF dataset and tokenizer. To avoid downloading the entire corpus, we support streaming, tokenizing, and chunking data on-the-fly. We provide an example for FineWebEdu-100BT in `data/datasets/prepare_finewebedu_100BT.sh`.

## ⚡️ Usage

Specify hyperparameters in `config.yaml` and launch training as follows:

#### Single GPU/CPU:
```bash
  python train.py --config=config/config.yaml
```
#### Multiple GPUs:
```bash
  torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=4 train.py --config=code/config/sweep.yaml
```

#### Run a sweep in parallel on a SLURM or Condor HPC cluster:

1. **Define hyperparameter sweep**:
  create a single YAML file with lists of hyperparameter values. Each value in the list will represent a different configuration, e.g.:
   ```yaml
   lr: [0.1, 0.01]
   wd: [0.1, 0.2, 0.5]
   beta1: 0.9
   ...
   ```
2. **Submit the sweep**: 
   Submit a job-array, where each job executes the same python script and reads the same configuration, but with a different `job_idx`. We use `job_idx` to map a job to its hyperparameters; `job_idx` should range from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of Cartesian product configurations in the YAML. This is done automatically by `cluster/slurm.sh` and `cluster/condor.sub`. Python takes care of assigning the corresponding configuration to each job based on the value of `job_idx`.
